<blockquote>
<p><em>Some people believe that television has had a positive influence on society. Others believe it has had a negative influence on society. Which do you agree with and why? Use details and examples to explain your opinion.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Television has both positive and negative impacts on society, but I lean towards the positive side. </p>
<p>Firstly, television is a powerful educational tool. For instance, educational programs like “Sesame Street” have been proven to enhance children’s learning abilities. Additionally, TV documentaries can broaden our horizons by exposing us to different cultures and histories, like the BBC’s “Planet Earth” series.</p>
<p>Secondly, television fosters a sense of community. During significant events, such as the Olympics or the Super Bowl, people gather around the TV to share these moments, which strengthens social bonds.</p>
<p>However, it’s also important to acknowledge the negative aspects. Excessive TV watching can lead to a sedentary lifestyle and health issues. Moreover, the content on TV can sometimes be violent or inappropriate, which might influence viewers, especially children, negatively.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while there are concerns, I believe the positive aspects of television, such as education and community building, outweigh the negatives when used responsibly. It’s crucial for viewers to be mindful of their consumption habits and for the industry to continue producing high-quality, enriching content.</p>
<p><strong>TPO 2</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Some college students choose to take courses in a variety of subject areas in order to get a broad education. Others choose to focus on a single subject area in order to have a deeper understanding of that area. Which approach to course selection do you think is better for students and why?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To be honest, I believe that it’s better for students to take courses in a variety of subject areas.</p>
<p>Firstly, a wide range of courses in differents areas can boraden students’ horizons and offer insights into the world. For intance, a student major in designing can benefit from some art courses and the other student studying invention can learn a lot from math and physics.</p>
<p>Secondly, if a student take part in different courses, they can meet more friends and thus improve their social skills. A students with more friends can get more help when he encounters difficulty.</p>
<p>Therefore … .</p>
<p><strong>TPO 3</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Some students prefer to work on class assignments by themselves. Others believe it is better to work in a group. Which do you prefer? Explain why.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I prefer working in a group on class assignments. </p>
<p>Group work allows for diverse perspectives, which can lead to more creative and comprehensive solutions. For instance, when tackling a marketing project, a design major might bring fresh visual ideas, while a business major could offer insights into strategy. </p>
<p>Additionally, group work enhances communication and teamwork skills, which are essential in the professional world. Collaborating with others also helps distribute the workload, making the task less overwhelming. </p>
<p>Overall, group assignments foster a supportive learning environment and prepare students for future collaborative endeavors.</p>
<p><strong>TPO 4</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Many universities now offer academic courses over the Internet. However, some people still prefer learning in traditional classrooms. Which do you think is better? Explain why.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I prefer studying on the Internet.</p>
<p>Firstly, students can reply the vedios at any time and space. If they have any questions, they can pause as they want, thus comlpletely know the answer.</p>
<p>Secondly, it’s better for students to study for the exams. This is because a student can go over the key chapters before the exams, thus they can clear their confusion totally. In this case, they can know the concept and how to apply these knowledge, thus perform well in the exam.</p>
<p>Therefore … .</p>
<p><strong>TPO 5</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Why or why not? Use details and examples to explain your answer.It is more important to study math or science than it is to study art or literature.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To be honest, I don’t argee with the statement that it is more important to study math or science than it is to study art or literature.</p>
<p>On the one hand, while studying math or science can make our physical life better and better, art and literature can amplify our spiritual life, thus maintaining our mental health. </p>
<p>On the other hand, a society without art and literature can not guarantee the holistic development of individuals. By promoting holistic development, we can raise a generation of individuals who are not only knowledgeable but also compassionate, creative, and adaptable.</p>
<p>Therefore … .</p>
<p><strong>TPO 6</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Some people have one career throughout their lives. Other people do different kinds of work at different points in their lives. Which do you think is better? Explain why.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To be honest, I think different kinds of work at different points in their lives can be better.</p>
<p>Firstly, if you do different kinds of work in differnet areas, you can learn more knowledge. An exposure to differnet areas can broaden our horizon and offer insights into the world, thus it’s a kind of invaluable experience in our life.</p>
<p>Secondly, different kinds of work in differnet areas allow us to meet different friends. This improve your social skills and when you encounter difficulity, you can get many help.</p>
<p>Therefore … .</p>
<p><strong>TPO 7</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>State whether you agree or disagree with the following statement. Then explain your reasons, using specific details in your explanation. Learning through online courses is more effective than learning in the traditional classroom setting.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>TPO 8</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Some people enjoy taking risks and trying new things. Others are not adventurous: they are cautious and prefer to avoid danger. Which behavior do you think is better? Explain why.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To be honest, I think enjoying taking risks and trying new things is better.</p>
<p>Firstly, taking risks and trying new things can broaden our horizons. An adventuous person can explore the boundary of his world and life, thus it will be an invaluable experience in his life.</p>
<p>Secondly, although taking risks is dangerous and may face mistakes and failure, it can help a person developing the quality of resilience. An indicidual with resilience will continuously try to do things in spite of the difficulty and will have big achievement in the future.</p>
<p>Therefore … .</p>
<h2><span id="真题">真题</span></h2><p><strong>真题61</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Students can learn school subjects as effectively through online videos as they can from classroom teaching. Use details and examples to explain your opinion.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To be honest, I don’t agree with the statement that students can learn school subjects as effectively through online videos as they can from classroom teaching.</p>
<p>First off, since there are no teachers to supervise students, their attention will be inevitably distracted. If they work in the classrooms, they can focus their minds on the subjects.</p>
<p>Moreover, teachers cannot adapt their class content from students’ feedback. If they can ask questions in the classrooms, teachers’ answers will clear their confusion.</p>
<p>Therefore, I don’t agree with the statement.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>看到隐含比较的题目，第一时间想到了要进行对比，不过这里也可以用其他方法补充细节，比如：<br>…, their attention will be inevitably distracted by their mobile phones and computers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>真题62</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>To help ensure students have enough time for studying, your school is considering placing a limit on the number of student clubs, sports, or organizations that a student is allowed to join. Do you think this is a good idea? Explain why or why not, using specific details and examples in your response.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To be honest, I don’t think it’s a good idea to place a limit on the number of organization and clubs.</p>
<p>First off, such an action will hinder students’ rounded development. With a wide range of acticities, students can develop their interests thus know what they want to do, such as reading books and playing football.</p>
<p>Moreover, various activities can help students relax thus they can devote much more time into study. So it sounds ironic to ensure student’s time on study by placing a limit on the number of activities.</p>
<p><strong>真题63</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Some professors allow students who have not done well on graded assignments during a course to do additional assignments in order to improve their overall course grade. Do you think this is a good idea? Explain why or why not. Use details and examples to support your opinion.</em></p>

<p>Allowing students to improve their grades through additional assignments is a beneficial practice. It fosters a growth mindset, encouraging students to learn from their mistakes and perseverence. </p>
<p>For instance, a student who performs poorly on a midterm can use the opportunity to review and master the material, potentially leading to a better final exam score. </p>
<p>By providing a chance to recover, educators show empathy and support, which can enhance students’ motivation and engagement. So I think it’s a good idea.</p>

<p><em>Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents should control the access their children have to social media. Use details and examples to explain your response.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To be honest, I agree with the statement that parents should control the access their children have to social media, because there are much harmful and dagerous infomation on it, and children are at the stage to form their world view and values.</p>
<p>For example, children under 12 years old should not be exposed to games including violence, which will lead them to form a bad and false world view and values.</p>
<p>Therefore, I agree with the statement.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Children need to learn at an early age how to be independent. Use details and examples to explain your answer.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To be honest, I agree with the statement that children need to learn at an early age how to be independent.</p>
<p>This is because independence is one of the necessory qualities that an adult should have.If a child cannot develop self-reliance, let alone the adult he grows to. An dependent adult cannot cook and wash clothes for himself, not to mention pursue his dreams.</p>
<p>Therefore, I agree with the statement.</p>
<p>Kimi:</p>
<p>I agree that children should learn independence early on. </p>
<p>Developing self-reliance fosters a sense of responsibility and resilience. For instance, teaching a child to dress themselves or make their bed instills pride and autonomy. It prepares them for more significant challenges, such as academic pursuits and social interactions. </p>
<p>Moreover, independent children are more likely to adapt to new environments, like starting school or making new friends. </p>
<p>However, the process should be gradual and age-appropriate, ensuring children don’t feel overwhelmed. Balancing guidance with independence nurtures well-rounded individuals ready for life’s complexities.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>When taking notes during a lecture or meeting, some people prefer to write them by hand on paper. Other people prefer to take notes by typing them on a laptop or other device. Which do you prefer? Explain why, using details and examples.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To be honest, I prefer taking notes by typing on the laptop or screen when on the lecture and meeting.</p>
<p>This is because it’s convenient and safe to save notes on the laptop. When I need to go over the notes, I can just tap the screen, click the mouse and open the folder whenever and wherever I want. If I take notes on the paper, It can be easily loss.</p>
<p>Therefore, I prefer taking notes by typing on the laptop or screen when on the lecture and meeting.</p>

<p><em>Nowadays, some people use extreme methods, including surgery, to change their appearance-usually because they are trying to look more attractive in some way. Do you think this is a good idea? Explain why you agree or disagree with people using such methods to change how they look. Support your opinion with details.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I disagree with using extreme methods like surgery to change one’s appearance for the sake of attractiveness. </p>
<p>While beauty standards can influence self-esteem, altering one’s body through surgery carries significant risks such as complications, scarring, and the potential for unsatisfactory results. </p>
<p>Moreover, societal pressure to conform to certain looks can lead to unrealistic expectations and a cycle of continuous dissatisfaction. Instead, fostering self-acceptance and promoting a healthy lifestyle can enhance attractiveness more genuinely. Confidence and a positive attitude often resonate more with others than superficial changes.</p>
<p><strong>真题68</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Some people think it is better to socialize on social media rather than in person. Which do you think is better? Explain why, using specific examples and details.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To be honest, I think it’s better to socialize in person.</p>
<p>First off, Socializing in person means face to face interactions, which can strengthen the relationship between friends rather than on social media.</p>
<p>Moreover, frequent chances in socialzing in person can make a person more confident and improve his social skills. If one person devotes more time on social media, he is more likely to be introverted.</p>
<p>Therefore, I prefer socializing in person.</p>

<p><em>Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Students can learn school subjects as effectively through online videos as they can from classroom teaching. Use details and examples to explain your opinion.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Honestly, I agree with the statement that students can learn through online vedios as effectively as they do from traditional classrooms.</p>
<p>First off, I think this can help students to understand the class content better. This is because while watching the vedios, they can pause if they have any questions. Then they can look it up online. In this case, they can better understand the lecture and follow along the professor. </p>
<p>Besides, watching vedios can help students to study for exams. This is because before the exams they can reply the videos; they can go over those key chapters. In this case, they can better understand the concepts and their applications. So they can do well in the exams.</p>
<p>Therefore, I agree with the statement. </p>

<p><em>Imagine that you live in a crowded city with only one green space—the city park. To address the issue of overcrowding, the city council has proposed building a new housing complex on this last green space in the city center. Do you think this is a good idea? Explain why or why not.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Honestly, I think it’s a bad idea to build a housing complex over this only green space in the city.</p>
<p>First off, I think the park, the green space, is essential to people’s lives. This is because a lot of people use the park every day, like they work out in the morning and in the evening they take a relaxing walk. So if the park is destroyed, they have no place to work out or relax.</p>
<p>Besides, the park is also very important for animals. This is because a lot of birds, you know they need the trees to build nests on, and sqirrels, they need the trees to look for food. So without the park they cannot survive.</p>
<p>Therefore, I think this is a bad idea.</p>

<p>这里给出一个我自己的i人回答：</p>
<p>Honestly, I would like to celebrate special occasions with just a few people.</p>
<p>First off, I am not a people person. I enjoy spending time on doing things I like or with a few people, which makes me feel comfortable. I will feel embarrassed with lots of people, especially those who I am just on nodding terms with.</p>
<p>Besides, celebrating special occasions with a few people can really save my energy. I behave relaxingly in front of a few people. I can open my heart to those who are my best friends.</p>
