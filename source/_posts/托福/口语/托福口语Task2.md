> Library Green Roof
> 
> In cities, people sometimes cover a rooftop with plants, such as grass and trees, creating what is called a green roof. I think the university should install a green roof on the campus library. The plants and soil would provide a layer of insulation to help maintain the building's temperature inside, so it would lower the costs of heating and cooling, meaning the university would save money. Also, since it's an urban campus, there aren't many green spaces for studying outside, and creating a green roof on the library would give students a nice option for studying outdoors. 
> 
> Sincerely.
> 
> Tom Harvey

Tom Harvey proposes installing a green roof on the university library, highlighting potential energy savings and creating an outdoor study space in an urban setting. 

However, the woman doubts the proposal's viability, pointing out several concerns. 

Firstly, she questions the financial benefits due to the library's old structure, suggesting that significant upfront investments in structural support and material changes would be needed to accommodate the green roof's weight. This, combined with ongoing maintenance costs, could offset any savings on heating and cooling expenses. 

Secondly, she challenges the idea of the green roof being a pleasant study space, arguing that the noise from city traffic and nearby construction would detract from its usability as a quiet outdoor area for students. These reasons lead her to conclude that, despite its potential benefits, the proposal might not achieve its intended outcomes due to practical and environmental challenges.

**真题72**

> Create a Week-Long Fall Break
> 
> Currently, the fall semester includes two short breaks, but I think the university should rearrange the schedule and combine these two breaks to create a week-long vacation. Having a full week of vacation would help students rest and relax better than the short breaks, since students would have a full week without having to go to class or hand in assignments. Additionally, this would benefit students who may have research papers or big assignments that are due at the end of the semester, because it would give them a block of uninterrupted time that they could use to complete these assignments.
> 
> Sincerely.
> 
> George Young


George Young proposes combining the two short breaks in the fall semester into one week-long vacation to benefit students by providing rest and a significant block of time to work on major assignments. 

However, the woman disagrees with this proposal. 

She argues that the existing shorter breaks throughout the semester are crucial for offering necessary rest and preventing exhaustion, suggesting that a continuous stretch of classes without these breaks would be tiring. 

While acknowledging the theoretical benefit of having more time for assignments, she doubts most students would use a week-long break productively. Drawing from personal experience and observations about behavior during spring break, she believes students are more likely to relax or travel than focus on academic work. Ultimately, she views the proposal as potentially more stressful and unrealistic in terms of improving assignment completion among students.
