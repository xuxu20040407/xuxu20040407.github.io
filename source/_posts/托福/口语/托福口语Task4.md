> Using the professor's points and examples, summarize the lecture about dams.

The lecture discusses the benefits and drawbacks of dam construction. Dams, useful for allocating water for human activities in arid regions, also negatively impact wildlife. 

They obstruct animal migration and life cycles, as seen with salmon unable to swim upstream to spawn due to dams blocking their path. 

Additionally, dams modify river flow and geography, leading to habitat loss for species dependent on the riverside ecosystem. An example provided is a South American bird species that lost its habitat when a dam flood destroyed the tall grass it lived in. 

This summary highlights dams' complex role in aiding human activity while posing ecological challenges.
