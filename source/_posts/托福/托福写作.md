- Further Elaboration;
- Sublimation.

**Begin**
- I believe that ...
- I firmly hold the idea that ...
- In my opinion, ...
- As far as I am concern, ...
- It's obviously that ...

**Point then Elaboration**
- Practical experience will greatly promote / hinder students' academic development **as** they can deepen their understanding in their field of study.
- The overuse of technology will have a positive / negative impact on our personal development **since** it will hinder ourindependent thinking.
- We shall definitely prioritize economic development over environmental protection **due to the fact that** a stable economy is the very foundation of social, scientific, andindustrial development.

**Elaboration then Point**
- The fact that discussion involves active exchange of ideas between participants **indicates that** such style of learning drives us to strengthen our communication skills.

**Example**
- Substaintiation: Abstract to Concrete;
  - **For example**, the score on a mathematics test indicates if the student has complete understood formulas and theories, and if they can apply them in various conditions.
  - **For example**, college students may seek the answer to the philosophical problem “the purpose of life" on the internet instead of thinking about it by themselves, generating little value to their life and study.
- Story: Vivid with relevant details.
  - **For instance**, last week, my little niece had a homework from her biology class about animal behaviors. Instead of relying on limited knowledge on books, she used her mobile phone to search for diverse information on the internet, including why and how animals play, which earned her a good grade for the excellent work.
  - **For instance**, one of my best college courses was taught by a retired engineering from the Ford car company. The instructor frequently used vivid real stories from the manufacturing floor to attract our attention and help us understand key concepts.

**Concession then Refutation**

## Sample 1 - Comparison

Write a post responding to the professor's question.

**In your response, you should**
- express and support your opinion;
- make a contribution to the discussion in your own words.

An effective response will contain **at least** 100 words.

**Professor:**

Today, we are going to talk about grading criteria in classes. Some teachers take students' effort in class into account, and may give students good grades or scores even they have not done well in assignments or tests; other teachers give good grades only to students who have performed well in assignments and tests. Which approach do you think is better: **assessing students based only on their performance, or also based ontheir effort?**

**Student 1:**

I believe grading shall primarily be based on students performance, but hard effort should also be considered. Students learn something from their **hard work** even if they do not score so well in tests, which will **benefit them in their future life.**

**Student 2:**

Well, only performance should be considered. lt is the only **fair** solution. Why should those who submit incorrect answers on their homework get the same score as l do? The so-called hard work is not relevant.


**Model Essay 1:**

I believe grading shall focus on students' performance on assignments and tests, since it is the most effective way to measure the progress in their study.

**To be more specific**, performance on assignments and tests best reflects students' understanding of academic concepts and their problem-solving skills, which are also the objective of most courses.

**For example**, the score on a mathematics test indicates if the student has complete understood formulas and theories, and if they can apply them in various conditions.

**Still**, some might claim that students learn something beneficial to their life through their hard effort regardless of the performance. However, we all need to learn form our mistakes and correct them in time, instead of persisting on wrong ideas or approaches.

> 值得注意的是，提及教授的观点是必要的，但是学生的观点是选择性的。处于独立思考的原则，你可以反对你反对的点，却不一定要从同样的角度支持你支持的观点。比如我觉得Fair不好解释，那么就不用提及。
> 
> 本文除了从另一个角度（成绩能反应能力）支持了performance grading的观点，同时指出了另一个观点的错误，体现了题干对better的要求，或者说对比类题型的本质。

## Sample 2 - Evaluation

Write a post responding to the professor's question.

**In your response, you should**
- express and support your opinion;
- make a contribution to the discussion in your own words.

An effective response will contain **at least** 100 words.

**Professor:**

Today, we are going to discuss the transition of new graduates into university. Many new high-school graduates work, travel, or just relax for some time before they attend university, and some even take a whole year-namely the gap year. Some say they have benefited greatly from their gap year, whileothers say it is a waste of time. **What is your opinion on gap year? Does it bring more advantages of disadvantages to students?**

**Student 1:**

I am completely up for gap year. lt is a great chance for students to **reflect on** what they are going to study in the future. They can have **hands-on experience** of different fields and witness the world in their own eyes.


**Student 2:**

We need to finish university **as soon as possible** or we are wasting money. Tuition, rent, books, and everything are becoming more **expensive** every year. The money students can make in a gap year will not be able to cove the extra money to be paid later.

**Model Essay 1:**

I believe gap year will greatly promote students' academic development as students can deepen their understanding in their future filed of study.

**To elaborate**, practical experience during the gap year will help students witness the true nature of a job instead of developing impractical imagination based on their limited experience, building a real passion in their future pursuit.

**For instance**, one of my best learning  experience was an internship before college with the Ford Car Company. The experience form the manufacturing floor helpped me understand key concepts in car prouction and problems to be solved.

**Still**, a voice arises that the cost of attending college rises each year, and we need to start college life as soon as possible. **Ironically**, such cost is nothing compared with the life-long regret of studying a wrong major.

**Model Essay 2:**

I believe gap year will greatly promote students' academic development as students can deepen their understanding in their future filed of study.

**To elaborate**, practical experience during the gap year will help students witness the true nature of a job instead of developing impractical imagination based on their limited experience, building a real passion in their future pursuit.

**Moreover**, the experience of communicating with people form various backgrounds through a job or during a trip will greatly enhance students' social skills, which are essential in their future study.

**To be more specific**, students will be able to exchange ideas accurately and smoothly with other students and professors in lectures, group discussions and projects, which promotes an effective learning experience.

## Sample 3 - Argument

Write a post responding to the professor's question.

**In your response, you should**
- express and support your opinion;
- make a contribution to the discussion in your own words.

An effective response will contain **at least** 100 words.

**Professor:**

Today we will cover the business concept of employment retention and training. Even if we are able to hire the best skilled workers from the job market, businesses still need to help them develop their skills in this fast-paced society. So managers usually need to decide on what and how much training to be given to the employees. In your opinion, do you think **ongoing job training is the most important investment a business can make**?

**Student 1:**

I totally disagree with such a statement. Companies can simply find and hire the best employees from the job market. There are many aspects in which companies need to spend their money on, and we need to** save money **from training.

**Student 2:**

Training is essential to employment retention. In otherwords, we need to make every effort to make employees stay. Through training, employees will feel that they are **valued** by the company, and will thus want to **stay**.

- make a contribution to the discussion in your own words.

An effective response will contain **at least** 100 words.

**Professor:**

In this lecture, we will look into how modern consumers buy tech products. Today, when people need a tech product, such as a tablet or mobile phone, they usually find that they do not have adequate information to make the purchasing decision. In this discussion,please let us know what do you think is **the biggest mistake that people make when it comes to the purchase of tech products.** Please explain what this mistake is and why.

**Student 1:**

The biggest issue is that people **do not match what they need and what they buy.** For example, my friend got the latest release of a laptop but found that he did not need much of the fancy functions. He actually paid for what he does not need.

**Student 2:**

I think people tend to forget about the **software**. When people buy tech products, they might ignore the software that come with the hardware. For example, it might be challenging to learn a new operating system on a laptop.
