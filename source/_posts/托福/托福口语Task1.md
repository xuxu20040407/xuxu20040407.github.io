**TPO 1**

> *Some people believe that television has had a positive influence on society. Others believe it has had a negative influence on society. Which do you agree with and why? Use details and examples to explain your opinion.*

Television has both positive and negative impacts on society, but I lean towards the positive side. Firstly, television is a powerful educational tool. For instance, educational programs like "Sesame Street" have been proven to enhance children's learning abilities. Additionally, TV documentaries can broaden our horizons by exposing us to different cultures and histories, like the BBC's "Planet Earth" series.

Secondly, television fosters a sense of community. During significant events, such as the Olympics or the Super Bowl, people gather around the TV to share these moments, which strengthens social bonds.

However, it's also important to acknowledge the negative aspects. Excessive TV watching can lead to a sedentary lifestyle and health issues. Moreover, the content on TV can sometimes be violent or inappropriate, which might influence viewers, especially children, negatively.

In conclusion, while there are concerns, I believe the positive aspects of television, such as education and community building, outweigh the negatives when used responsibly. It's crucial for viewers to be mindful of their consumption habits and for the industry to continue producing high-quality, enriching content.

**TPO 2**
> *Some students prefer to work on class assignments by themselves. Others believe it is better to work in a group. Which do you prefer? Explain why.*

I prefer working in a group on class assignments. 

Group work allows for diverse perspectives, which can lead to more creative and comprehensive solutions. For instance, when tackling a marketing project, a design major might bring fresh visual ideas, while a business major could offer insights into strategy. 

Additionally, group work enhances communication and teamwork skills, which are essential in the professional world. Collaborating with others also helps distribute the workload, making the task less overwhelming. 

Overall, group assignments foster a supportive learning environment and prepare students for future collaborative endeavors.


**真题61**
>*Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Students can learn school subjects as effectively through online videos as thev can from classroom teaching. Use details and examples to explain your opinion.*

To be honest, I don't agree with the statement that students can learn school subjects as effectively through online videos as they can from classroom teaching.

First off, since there are no teachers to supervise students, their attention will be inevitably distracted. If they work in the classrooms, they can focus their minds on the subjects.

Moreover, teachers cannot adapt their class content from students' feedback. If they can ask questions in the classrooms, teachers' answers will clear their confusion.

Therefore, I don't agree with the statement.

> 看到隐含比较的题目，第一时间想到了要进行对比，不过这里也可以用其他方法补充细节，比如：
> ..., their attention will be inevitably distracted by their mobile phones and computers.



**真题62**
> *To help ensure students have enough time for studying, your school is considering placing a limit on the number of student clubs, sports, or organizations that a student is allowed to join. Do you think this is a good idea? Explain why or why not, using specific details and examples in your response.*

To be honest, I don't think it's a good idea to place a limit on the number of organization and clubs.

First off, such an action will hinder students' rounded development. With a wide range of acticities, students can develop their interests thus know what they want to do, such as reading books and playing football.

Moreover, various activities can help students relax thus they can devote much more time into study. So it sounds ironic to ensure student's time on study by placing a limit on the number of activities.

**真题63**
> *Some professors allow students who have not done well on graded assignments during a course to do additional assignments in order to improve their overall course grade. Do you think this is a good idea? Explain why or why not. Use details and examples to support your opinion.*


Allowing students to improve their grades through additional assignments is a beneficial practice. It fosters a growth mindset, encouraging students to learn from their mistakes and perseverence. 

For instance, a student who performs poorly on a midterm can use the opportunity to review and master the material, potentially leading to a better final exam score. 

By providing a chance to recover, educators show empathy and support, which can enhance students' motivation and engagement. So I think it's a good idea.

**真题64**
> *Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents should control the access their children have to social media. Use details and examples to explain your response.*

To be honest, I agree with the statement that parents should control the access their children have to social media, because there are much harmful and dagerous infomation on it, and children are at the stage to form their world view and values.

For example, children under 12 years old should not be exposed to games including violence, which will lead them to form a bad and false world view and values.

Therefore, I agree with the statement.

**真题65**
> *Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Children need to learn at an early age how to be independent. Use details and examples to explain your answer.*

To be honest, I agree with the statement that children need to learn at an early age how to be independent.

This is because independence is one of the necessory qualities that an adult should have.If a child cannot develop self-reliance, let alone the adult he grows to. An dependent adult cannot cook and wash clothes for himself, not to mention pursue his dreams.

Therefore, I agree with the statement.

Kimi:

I agree that children should learn independence early on. 

Developing self-reliance fosters a sense of responsibility and resilience. For instance, teaching a child to dress themselves or make their bed instills pride and autonomy. It prepares them for more significant challenges, such as academic pursuits and social interactions. 

Moreover, independent children are more likely to adapt to new environments, like starting school or making new friends. 

However, the process should be gradual and age-appropriate, ensuring children don't feel overwhelmed. Balancing guidance with independence nurtures well-rounded individuals ready for life's complexities.

**真题66**
> *When taking notes during a lecture or meeting, some people prefer to write them by hand on paper. Other people prefer to take notes by typing them on a laptop or other device. Which do you prefer? Explain why, using details and examples.*

To be honest, I prefer taking notes by typing on the laptop or screen when on the lecture and meeting.

This is because it's convenient and safe to save notes on the laptop. When I need to go over the notes, I can just tap the screen, click the mouse and open the folder whenever and wherever I want. If I take notes on the paper, It can be easily loss.

Therefore, I prefer taking notes by typing on the laptop or screen when on the lecture and meeting.

**真题67**
> *Nowadays, some people use extreme methods, including surgery, to change their appearance-usually because they are trying to look more attractive in some way. Do you think this is a good idea? Explain why you agree or disagree with people using such methods to change how they look. Support your opinion with details.*

I disagree with using extreme methods like surgery to change one's appearance for the sake of attractiveness. 

While beauty standards can influence self-esteem, altering one's body through surgery carries significant risks such as complications, scarring, and the potential for unsatisfactory results. 

Moreover, societal pressure to conform to certain looks can lead to unrealistic expectations and a cycle of continuous dissatisfaction. Instead, fostering self-acceptance and promoting a healthy lifestyle can enhance attractiveness more genuinely. Confidence and a positive attitude often resonate more with others than superficial changes.

**真题68**
> *Some people think it is better to socialize on social media rather than in person. Which do you think is better? Explain why, using specific examples and details.*

To be honest, I think it's better to socialize in person.

First off, Socializing in person means face to face interactions, which can strengthen the relationship between friends rather than on social media.

Moreover, frequent chances in socialzing in person can make a person more confident and improve his social skills. If one person devotes more time on social media, he is more likely to be introverted.

Therefore, I prefer socializing in person.

>*Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Students can learn school subjects as effectively through online videos as they can from classroom teaching. Use details and examples to explain your opinion.*

Honestly, I agree with the statement that students can learn through online vedios as effectively as they do from traditional classrooms.

First off, I think this can help students to understand the class content better. This is because while watching the vedios, they can pause if they have any questions. Then they can look it up online. In this case, they can better understand the lecture and follow along the professor. 
 
Besides, watching vedios can help students to study for exams. This is because before the exams they can reply the videos; they can go over those key chapters. In this case, they can better understand the concepts and their applications. So they can do well in the exams.
 
Therefore, I agree with the statement.

>*Imagine that you live in a crowded city with only one green space—the city park. To address the issue of overcrowding, the city council has proposed building a new housing complex on this last green space in the city center. Do you think this is a good idea? Explain why or why not.*

Honestly, I think it's a bad idea to build a housing complex over this only green space in the city.

First off, I think the park, the green space, is essential to people's lives. This is because a lot of people use the park every day, like they work out in the morning and in the evening they take a relaxing walk. So if the park is destroyed, they have no place to work out or relax.

Besides, the park is also very important for animals. This is because a lot of birds, you know they need the trees to build nests on, and sqirrels, they need the trees to look for food. So without the park they cannot survive.

Therefore, I think this is a bad idea.

>*Some people prefer to shop for groceries at specialty shops such as butcher shops and bakeries. Others prefer to shop for everything at once at a supermarket. Which do you think is better and why? Use details and examples to support your answer.*

Honestly, I would like to shop at large grocery stores or department stores. 

First off, this helps me to save money. Well this is because these large stores, they usually have better deals. Like, their soft drinks are often on sale, buy one and get one free. You know, by shopping at these large grocery of department stores, it can really help me to make ends meet.

Besides,I would like to shop at large places because it's more convenient. Well, this is because the stores often have a large selection of goods. Basically, I can find everything I need from groceries to clothes. So, doing this kind of one stop shopping really can help me to save time.

Therefore, I would like to shop at large grocery stores or department stores.

>*Some people like to celebrate their birthday or holidays with large gatherings orparties; other people prefer to celebrate in quieter ways alone or with just a few people. Which do you prefer? Explain why.*

Honestly, I would like to celebrate special occasions with a large number of people.

First off, I can receive more gifts in this way. Well, this is because these many guests will bring me a lot of gifts, you know, gifts I have been longing for. So when I open gifts, I will just feel so acknowledged and valued by all of them.

Besides, I would like to celebrate with a large number of people because it will be more fun. This is because we can play a lot of interesting games like charades or even Truth or Dare. In this case, I can totaly enjoy the company of all my friends

So because of these two reasons, I think it is better to celebrate important occasions with a large number of people.

这里给出一个我自己的i人回答：

Honestly, I would like to celebrate special occasions with just a few people.

First off, I am not a people person. I enjoy spending time on doing things I like or with a few people, which makes me feel comfortable. I will feel embarrassed with lots of people, especially those who I am just on nodding terms with.

Besides, celebrating special occasions with a few people can really save my energy. I behave relaxingly in front of a few people. I can open my heart to those who are my best friends.

So because of these two reasons, I prefer celebrating important occasions with a few people.
